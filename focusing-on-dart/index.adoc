[#why]
== Why focus on the language?

- Create and maintain *confidence*
- Avoid *FUD* +
  **F**ear +
  **U**ncertainty and +
  **D**oubt

programming is a complex activity +
easy to get turned around +

[#confidence]
=== Sources of confidence

* Where does _false_ confidence come from?
* Where does _real_ confidence come from?


[#false-confidence]
=== Sources of _false confidence_

* "Looks easy"
* Assumed Familiarity


[#real-confidence]
=== Sources of _real confidence_

* Durable feedback loops from
** Your compiler
** Example programs
** Automated tests

* Fleeting feedback loops from
** Emulators and Devices
** Stateful Live Reload

Flutter makes it look easy

[#fud]
=== Sources of FUD

* Over Confidence
** Skipping example programs
** Skipping automated tests
** Dart isn't Java/Javascript/etc

* Leaky Abstractions
** Android and iOS didn't go away


[#what]
== What do we need to understand?

* Programs
* Variables
* Objects
* Functions
* Types


[#programs]
== Programs


[#programs-a]
=== Programs ...


[#programs-b]
=== Programs ...


[#variables]
== Variables


[#variables-a]
=== Variables ...
blah, blah, blah


[#variables-b]
=== Variables ...
blah, blah, blah


[#objects]
== Objects


[#functions]
== Functions


[#types]
== Types

* Short for data types
* Seven "special" types
** Five "everyday" types
** Two "rainy day" types

[#seven-types]
=== Special?

* Language provides a *Dedicated Syntax*
* Represent the most essential or common objects our programs are built with

[#everyday-types]
=== Everyday?

[#everyday-numbers]
=== Everyday: numbers

`1`

`1.0`

[#everyday-strings]
=== Everyday: strings

`"New phone"`

`"Who 'dis?"`

[#everyday-booleans]
=== Everyday: booleans

`true`

`false`

[#everyday-lists]
=== Everyday: lists

lists (also known as arrays)

`[1, 2]`

`["potato", "tomato"]`

[#everyday-maps]
=== Everyday: maps

[#rainy-day-types]
=== Rainy day?

[%step]
* *runes*
[%step]
** represent individual characters in a string

* *symbols*
[%step]
** represent operators or identifiers
** important for minifiers, but
** you might not ever use them

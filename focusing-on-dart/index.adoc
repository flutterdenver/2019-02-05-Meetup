[#why]
== Why focus on the language?

* To promote *confidence*
* To avoid *FUD* +
  ::
  **F**ear +
  **U**ncertainty and +
  **D**oubt

[NOTE.speaker]
--
::
programming is a complex activity +
easy to get turned around +

[#confidence]
=== Confidence

* Why is confidence important?
** Programming is complex
** Managing high hopes and expectations

* How do we regulate confidence?
** Where does _false confidence_ come from?
** Where does _real confidence_ come from?


[#false-confidence]
=== false confidence

Where does _false confidence_ from from?

* "That looks easy"
* Assumed Familiarity


[#real-confidence]
=== real confidence

Where does _real confidence_ from from?

* Durable feedback loops
** Your compiler
** Example programs (and apps)
** Automated tests


[#real-confidence-b]
=== real confidence (cont...)

* Fleeting feedback loops
** Emulators and Devices
** Stateful Live Reload


[#fud]
=== Sources of FUD

* Over Confidence
** Fleeting feedback loops
** Skipping example programs
** Skipping automated tests
** Dart isn't Java/Javascript/etc

* Leaky Abstractions
** Android and iOS didn't go away


[#what]
== What do we need to understand?

// [%step]
* Program composition with Dart

* We need to know
** what components the language provides
** how these components work

* These components define ground rules for
** every library you'll encounter
** every program you'll create and maintain

[#programs]
== Programs (Apps)

* Programs are compositions

* Programs are composed with
// [%step]
** Variables
** Objects
** Functions
** Types


[#hello-world]
=== Hello, World

[source, dart]
----
//  examples/hello_world/main.dart
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='2..4', indent=4]
----


[#main-defined]
=== What is `main`?

* `main`
** is a required function
** is the entry point to your program
** ultimately defines what your app does


[#main-anatomy]
=== Dissecting `main`

[source, dart]
----
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='2', indent=4]
//  ^^^^           this is the function name
----

[source, dart]
----
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='2', indent=4]
//       ^^        these are the function arguments
//                 (there are no arguments in this example)
----

[source, dart]
----
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='2', indent=4]
//          ^      this brace opens the function body
----

[source, dart]
----
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='2..4', indent=4]
//  ^               this brace closes the function body
----


[#calling-print]
=== Calling `print`

Calling the `print` function

[source, dart]
----
include::examples/hello_world/main.dart[lines='3']
  ^^^^^
----


[#variables]
== Variables


[#variables-a]
=== Variables ...
blah, blah, blah


[#variables-b]
=== Variables ...
blah, blah, blah


[#objects]
== Objects


[#functions]
== Functions


[#types]
== Types

* Short for data types
* Seven "special" types
** Five "everyday" types
** Two "rainy day" types

[#seven-types]
=== Special?

* Language provides a *Dedicated Syntax*
* Represent the most essential or common objects our programs are built with

[#everyday-types]
=== Everyday?

[#everyday-numbers]
=== Everyday: numbers

`1`

`1.0`

[#everyday-strings]
=== Everyday: strings

`"Dart"`

`"Flutter"`

[#everyday-booleans]
=== Everyday: booleans

`true`

`false`

[#everyday-lists]
=== Everyday: lists

lists (also known as arrays)

`[1, 2]`

`["potato", "tomato"]`

[#everyday-maps]
=== Everyday: maps

[#rainy-day-types]
=== Rainy day?

// [%step]
* *runes*
// [%step]
** represent individual characters in a string

* *symbols*
// [%step]
** represent operators or identifiers
** important for minifiers, but
** you might not ever use them
